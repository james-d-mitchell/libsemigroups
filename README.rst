C++ library for semigroups and monoids
--------------------------------------

What is ``libsemigroups``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``libsemigroups``  is a C++11 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite and finitely presented semigroups. Namely:

- the `Froidure-Pin algorithm`_ for computing finite semigroups
  :cite:`Froidure1997aa`;
- the `Todd-Coxeter algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Knuth-Bendix algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Schreier-Sims algorithm`_ for permutation groups.

.. _Froidure-Pin algorithm: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf
.. _Todd-Coxeter algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd%E2%80%93Coxeter_algorithm
.. _Knuth-Bendix algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Bendix_completion_algorithm
.. _Schreier-Sims algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreier%E2%80%93Sims_algorithm

``libsemigroups`` is partly based on `Algorithms for computing finite
semigroups`_, `Expository Slides`_, and `Semigroupe 2.01`_ by `Jean-Eric Pin`_.  

.. _Algorithms for computing finite semigroups: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf 
.. _Expository slides: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Exposes/StAndrews.pdf
.. _Semigroupe 2.01: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html
.. _Jean-Eric Pin: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/

The main classes in ``libsemigroups`` are named after the algorithms they
implement; for example,  ``libsemigroups::FroidurePin``,
``libsemigroups::congruence::ToddCoxeter``, 
``libsemigroups::fpsemigroup::KnuthBendix``, and
``libsemigroups::SchreierSims``.

The implementations in ``libsemigroups::FroidurePin`` and
``libsemigroups::SchreierSims`` are generic and easily adapted to
user-defined types.

``libsemigroups`` uses: `HPCombi`_ which uses the SSE and AVX instruction sets
for very fast manipulation of transformations, partial permutations,
permutations, and boolean matrices of small size;  `catch`_ for tests; 
and `fmt`_ for reporting.
